            <h2>SKILLS</h2>
            <p>
                I've embarked on a journey to expand my skill set in the realm of programming, and as a beginner, I've
                made significant strides in studying several languages. Python, Java, R, C, and Dart & Flutter
                framework have become my tools of choice, each offering a unique perspective on software development. My
                curiosity extends to database management through SQL, enabling me to harness the power of data for
                various applications. Additionally, I've delved into the intricate world of low-level programming with
                Assembly, allowing me to gain valuable insights into the inner workings of computer systems. While I may
                be at the beginning of this exciting learning curve, my dedication and passion drive me to continually
                sharpen my skills and explore new horizons in the vast landscape of programming.

            <h2>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Danjes Andreinne S. Ferrer, and I'm 20 years old. I come from the Philippines, and I'm really
                enthusiastic about Computer Science. My interest in programming started as a curiosity but has grown
                into a lifelong passion. I'm currently studying at the University of the Philippines, which is
                well-regarded, and I'm working hard to improve my skills and knowledge in the constantly changing world
                of technology. When I write code, my goal is not just to come up with new solutions but also to make a
                positive impact on the digital world and explore the limits of what can be done. I'm just starting my
                journey, and I'm excited to see what challenges and opportunities lie ahead in this dynamic field.
