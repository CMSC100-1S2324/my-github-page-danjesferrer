## What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
- Designing in CSS is difficult for me because I don't know all the syntax and techniques to render an object.
- I'm not familiar with CSS selectors and there are a lot of them when I searched it online, but I don't know when to use them.
- It's really time-consuming to do the design from scratch.
